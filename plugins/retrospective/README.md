# Retrospective

A whole ceremony delivered as a plugin: columns, cards, hidden authorship until
the facilitator reveals, grouping, one-dot-per-person voting, and action items.

It does not live in `internal/` or `web/src`. The host already frames an unknown
kind in the full-room slot and exports the guest's `on_session_state` document as
CSV. This package is that guest, plus the iframe UI.

## Build, sign and install

```sh
make test bundle                     # dist/retrospective-0.1.0.parley, unsigned
make bundle KEY=path/to/signing.key  # the same, signed
```

`make bundle` downloads the pinned `extism-js` and Binaryen from
`sdk/plugin-sdk/extism.mk` into `.cache/`, compiles `board.js` + `guest.js` to
`plugin.wasm`, and packs it with `manifest.json` and `ui.js`. Make a key with
`node ../../sdk/plugin-sdk/src/cli.js keygen <prefix>` (or
`parley plugin keygen`); check a bundle with
`parley plugin verify -key "$(cat <prefix>.pub)" dist/retrospective-0.1.0.parley`.

To install, an admin of the default org uploads the `.parley` file on the
**Plugin catalog** page (`/catalog`), then an
org admin installs it from their org's **Plugins** page and accepts the grants.
The server accepts it only if it is signed by a key in `PLUGIN_TRUSTED_KEYS`,
or is unsigned and `PLUGIN_ALLOW_UNSIGNED=true`.

Every Parley release attaches `retrospective-<version>.parley`. When the
project's release key is configured, the bundle is signed with it and the
matching public key is attached beside it as `parley-plugin-signing.pub`; add
that key's contents to `PLUGIN_TRUSTED_KEYS` to trust official bundles. A
release without that file carries an unsigned bundle.

The grants it asks for:

- `kv` scoped to `board` — one document per session
- `session:read` — so the iframe is allowed to see the envelope
- `session:act` — so the iframe can propose the kind's actions

`make dist` still writes the legacy `PLUGIN_DIR` pair,
`dist/retrospective-0.1.0.wasm` and `dist/retrospective-0.1.0.ui.js`.
`package.json` is a copy of `manifest.json` kept for the host's consent-copy
test; the unit tests fail if the two differ.

## Storage (open question 2)

The host key-value store has get and set, not list or prefix scan. Grouping and
dot-voting therefore live on **one namespaced document** per session (`scope=board`,
`key=<session id>`). `on_session_state` reads that document; `on_session_action`
reads, mutates, writes. Concurrent writes are last-write-wins. Compare-and-swap
is still the right next step before #22 freezes the wire protocol; it is not
required to express the board.

## Disable and uninstall

Switching the install off is host behaviour: the room becomes `kindUnavailable`.
Switching it back on restores the kind. Uninstall is refused while sessions of
`retrospective` still exist. This plugin does not reimplement those.
